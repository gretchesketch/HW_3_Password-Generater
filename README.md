# HW_3_Password-Generater

After looking at the starter code I saw that I needed to declare generate password as a function.
From there I created my password library breaking them up into 4 groups of like characters. After this I created my first prompt that invited the user to enter a password length that had to meet a certain criteria. If they did meet it they would move on to the next phase of questions, if not they would get an alert that stated they needed to meet the criteria. The next phases of questions ask if they would like to include certain characters, or not, into the generated password. After each question has been assigned either a true or false by the user, only the true criteria would pass into the randomly generated return.
